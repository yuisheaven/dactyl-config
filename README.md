# dactyl-config QWERTZ German
Keyboard configuration QWERTZ for Dactyl keyboard

This is made to support a pretty much native German Layout experience.
The system keyboard input has to be put to US Keyboard layout. 
Then, when writing and using the shift keys and so on, it will act like a German keyboard.
